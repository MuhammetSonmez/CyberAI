          "A Web Service Amplification Attack is a type of DDoS attack that takes advantage of the functionality of open web services to amplify the attack traffic. Amplification attacks increase impact by eliciting a response from the server that is larger than the original request. Commonly exploited protocols include DNS, NTP, and SSDP. Protection involves configuring servers to prevent misuse, rate limiting, and using DDoS protection services. Tools like network firewalls and anti-DDoS services can help mitigate these attacks."
